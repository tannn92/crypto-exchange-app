# E2E Test Environment Setup Guide

## 🎯 **Goal: Execute E2E Tests Against Real App**

The E2E tests are complete and ready to run, but require proper environment setup.

## 📋 **Setup Checklist**

### **1. Install iOS Simulator Dependencies**
```bash
# Install applesimutils for iOS simulator control
brew tap wix/brew
brew install applesimutils

# Verify installation
applesimutils --version
```

### **2. Fix CocoaPods Environment**
```bash
# Update Ruby gems to resolve ActiveSupport conflict
gem update activesupport

# Or use system Ruby instead of rbenv
which ruby  # Should show system Ruby path

# Clean and reinstall CocoaPods
gem uninstall cocoapods
gem install cocoapods

# Verify CocoaPods
pod --version
```

### **3. Build App for Testing**
```bash
# Clean any existing builds
rm -rf ios/build
rm -rf node_modules
npm install

# Build for E2E testing
npm run build:e2e:ios
```

### **4. Run E2E Tests**
```bash
# Run all E2E tests
npm run test:e2e:ios

# Or run specific flows
npx detox test e2e/buy-flow.test.js --configuration ios.sim
npx detox test e2e/sell-flow.test.js --configuration ios.sim
npx detox test e2e/convert-flow.test.js --configuration ios.sim
npx detox test e2e/deposit-flow.test.js --configuration ios.sim
npx detox test e2e/withdrawal-flow.test.js --configuration ios.sim
```

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

### **Issue 1: applesimutils not found**
```bash
# Solution: Install via Homebrew
brew tap wix/brew
brew install applesimutils
```

### **Issue 2: CocoaPods/Ruby conflicts**
```bash
# Solution: Use system Ruby
rbenv global system
gem install cocoapods
```

### **Issue 3: Expo build fails**
```bash
# Solution: Clean and rebuild
npx expo install --fix
rm -rf ios
npx expo run:ios --configuration Debug
```

### **Issue 4: Simulator not responding**
```bash
# Solution: Reset simulator
xcrun simctl erase all
xcrun simctl boot "iPhone 15"
```

## ✅ **Expected Results When Setup Complete**
